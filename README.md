# NoFallPlugin

A Minecraft Spigot plugin that prevents players from taking fall damage and teleports them to predefined spawn points if they fall below a certain Y-level. Supports multiple worlds and customizable spawn locations.

## Features

- **No Fall Damage**: Automatically cancels fall damage for players.
- **Void Teleport**: Teleports players back to a configured spawn point when they fall below a specified Y-level.
- **Multiple Worlds Support**: Set unique spawn points for different worlds, including worlds created with plugins like Multiverse.
- **Configurable**: Easily set and remove spawn locations using in-game commands.
- **List Spawn Locations**: See all configured void locations.

## Commands
